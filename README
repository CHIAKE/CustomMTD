This is CustomMTD for Android
a selection of flashable zip files that enable you to customise the size of your MTD partitions on android devices such as the G1, MT3G , Hero etc

MakeZips.sh, is a simple script to generate the various zip files
*bootimg, are blobs from http://github.com/koush/AnyKernel/tree/master/kernel/
patchbootimg.sh, is the main script this is executed in recovery via updater-script

TODO: update this readme with usefull info
      check system and cache size make sense ( e.g. that they are not too large for what is available )
      get msm_nand kernel modules to use kernel cmdline ( so we can resize mtd without having to reboot )
      check if the mtd sizes are actually being changed ( so we can AutoFormat the partitions, oe less thing for the user to do/forget )
