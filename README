This is CustomMTD for Android
a selection of flashable zip files that enable you to customise the size of your MTD partitions on android devices such as the G1, MT3G , Hero etc

MakeZips.sh, is a simple script to generate the various zip files
*bootimg, are blobs from http://github.com/koush/AnyKernel/tree/master/kernel/
patchbootimg.sh, is the main script this is executed in recovery via updater-script

TODO: update this readme with usefull info
      get msm_nand kernel modules to use kernel cmdline
          ( so we can resize mtd without having to reboot )
      check if the mtd sizes are actually being changed
          ( so we can AutoFormat the partitions, one less thing for the user to do/forget )
      check the order of partitions
          thunderc has presented a problem, cache is between boot and recovery, we can't shift recovery and have the spl boot it
          to make practical use of the /cache partition the only thing I can think of atm is to instead use it for system
          We still can't change its size, but at least we can have a larger data partition ( what was system is now a small cache)

New in v1.5.8-Alpha

Checks are made against the Nand size and user set size,
if data will be less than 50, patch bails out
User can opt to skip the 50mb limit by adding the line
anydatasize
to /sdcard/mtdpartmap.txt


User can size system and cache in blocks of 128k ( 0.125mb )
e.g.
mtd 67.5 1.5
will give system size 67.5 and cache 1.5
valid 'fractions' are .125 .250 .375 .5 .625 .75 and .875
